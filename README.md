# LGMVIP_JAVA_TASK1_Currency_Converter

A currency converter is a program that takes an amount in one currency and converts it to another currency based on the current exchange rate. The user enters the amount to be converted and selects the currencies to convert between. The program then retrieves the current exchange rate for the selected currencies and performs the conversion. Once you have retrieved the exchange rate, you can use it to convert the amount from one currency to another. You will need to take into account the exchange rate and any fees or charges that may be incurred during conversion process. Overall, a currency converter in Java involves retrieving exchange rates from an API and using them to convert amounts between different currencies. It requires knowledge of Java programming, APIs, and currency exchange rates.
